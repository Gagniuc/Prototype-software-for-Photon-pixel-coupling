# Prototype software for Photon-pixel coupling method

Photon-pixel coupling is a novel method that allows a parallel sampling of an unlimited number of sensors. In the case shown here, 200 sensors are sampled in parallel at video rate frequency. The Vesta software shown here analizes consecutive images from a special folder. Previously this folder is filled up with images from a dedicated WebCam software. This implementation is made in Visual Basic 6.0 (VB6). Please read:
